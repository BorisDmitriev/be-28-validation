# **Security-validation-sanitization**

## What you will do

Students will use ThunderClient to simulate username, email address, and password entries. They will need to validate the entries and ensure that the username is not blank, the email address is in a valid format, and the password has a minimum length of 8 characters.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Implement the Express route that takes user input and uses Express Validator for validation. Make sure that the username is not empty.

### Task 2

Validate the user's email address using Express Validator. Make sure that it has a valid format.

### Task 3

Add a validation rule for the password. The password should be at least 8 characters long.

### Task 4

Use Express Validator to clean up the user input. Remove spaces from the beginning and end of the username and email address.

## Notes

-   [Express Validator Documentation](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/)
-   Make sure you have the latest version of Express Validator installed.
